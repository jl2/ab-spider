This is the back end for an ad-blocking search engine.  It's responsible for crawling the web and building a list of user friendly websites.

My goal is to build a search engine that returns useful and relevant links to web sites without user-hostile advertising, tracking, and malware.

[I got the idea for this](https://lobste.rs/s/5bi46y/against_increasingly_user_hostile_web#c_6gurvj) after reading the discussion on Lobsters around [this article](https://www.neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/).  As somebody pointed out, it's not an original idea, but it sounds fun to work on.
